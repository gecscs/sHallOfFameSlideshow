<h1>Hall of Fame Slideshow</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Windows App intends to provide a way to navigate or slideshow the Cities: Skylines II images captured by the exelent mod created by Toverux outside of the game itself, saving the heavy cpu and memory load that it forces and still allowing you to see everyone's creations on out favorite game.</p>
<p>If you, like me, love just sitting back and enjoy seeing the creations by the CS2 community, either to relax or to provide you with inspiration for your own creations, please feel free to download and build this app on your computer.</p>
<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>Please use this app with moderation by abiding to the following rules of conduct:
  <ul>
    <li>Restrain from setting the slideshow interval to very low values that imply constant requests to mod creator server and increase massively it's contracted network traffic which implies extra costs to the Mod creator;</li>
    <li>Do not leave the slideshow running if you are not paying attention or afk;</li>
    <li>Do not in any way attempt to use this code abusively in such way that might lead to any type of harm or damage to anyone or thing.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>How to set up the app</h2>
<p><strong>Mandatory: </strong>You need to edit the appsettings.config file by replacing the following placeholders:
  <ul>
    <li>[YOUR_USERNAME]: Your Paradox username (the one you use in your game);</li>
    <li>[YOUR_CREATORID]: You can find your CreatorId on your mod folder tipically at <em>'%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModSettings\HallOfFame\HallOfFame.coc'</em>;</li>
    <li>[YOUR_HARDWAREID]: Any simple string identifier should suffice as long as you stick to it.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Additionaly, you can set the following parameters:
  <ul>
    <li>RandomValue, TrendingValue, RecentValue, ArcheologistValue, SupporterValue: Integer values from 0 to 10. These are the same as in the ingame mod settings;</li>
    <li>ViewMaxAgeValue: Integer value in days;</li>
    <li>SlideShowInterval: Integer value in seconds. <strong>Please do not go lower than 20</strong> to prevent abuse of traffic usage as explained on the above notes.</li>
    <li><strong>!!! DO NOT CHANGE THE GetRandomWeightedImageApiEndpoint VALUE !!!</strong></li>
  </ul> 
  Update these settings prior to building or publishing the app, otherwise it will fail to run properly.

<h2>Special thanks to</h2>

  <li>The entire CS2 community on discord that has provided me with support along the times, in particular Dragonae who helped me get through 'The Plague' by getting out of his way and downloading my 300k pop. city and finding the faulty links among such massive grid;</li>
  <li>Sully and all the community on his server for the local assets and ideias provided;</li>
  <li>All the modders and asset creators, without whom this game would be dead already and that keep amazing me with the extensions they provide to it everyday;</li>
